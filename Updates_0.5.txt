Generates PileUp Counts from Event List prior to Population of Matrices
Pileup is pickle-dumped to Pileup.py.pi
17-01-16
Only populates matrices if pileup reveals sufficient diversity, as specified with the --Pileup_Fraction in the command line, default is 0.001 (0.1%)

06-2016 
AA and NT scripts were combined. Default is NT. AA mode run if ORF start and Finish is provided.

Merge Script now takes in data from PileUp.py.pi file in order to fill negative correlations between recombination events present in oncec data, but absent in another merged one. 

07-2016 
Removed some Output_Direction options as these can be specified in the Output_File option.

Merge Script Merges pileup data (and only pileup data if requested)

07-2016 
Analysis Script reports LD, R2 and DMax (from which D' can be calculated)

07-2016 
Added new merge script that clusters similar recombination events, either from a single sample or from multiple

CoVaMa 0.4

Allow input SAM to be read from gapped-alignments (e.g. Bowtie2, Hisat2). This reads InDels from CIGAR string and ignores pads. CIGAR strings must be either I, D, N, S, or H in addition to the mapped M. D, N and I are treated as microinsertions/deletions as might have been found using ViReMa. 

Input can be short read illumima or long-read nanopore.

Seperate exclusion criteria for uInDels and larger recombination events. Two options now available: uInDel exclusion is number of nucs require either side of InDel, Rec Exclusion is same as before. 

uInDel length now specified in commandline rather than inferred from exclusion criteria. 
Label uInDels rigourously.
Remove default dict from pickle file (causes recursion error in large files). Save as dict.
Rename 'ViReMa' references.
Can set start and end nucleotides to including in mappings.

TODO:
Multiple SAM files e.g short and long reads
Accept BAM files
Rec only, rec-snv only, snv only.
